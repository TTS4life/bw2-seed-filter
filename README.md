# Black/White 2 Seed Filters
Repository of scripts used for filtering seeds in BW2 for Speedrunning.

# Credits 
- March - Initial scripts and groundwork
- TTS4life - TID for Normal Mode/Challenge Mode



Usage:
To run, you need lincon-lm's [numba-pokemon-rng](https://github.com/lincoln-lm/numba_pokemon_prngs) package. Please view the repo for installation instrucitons there.

After that, its 
```
python3 main.py
```


To filter a dataset, select a file at the top, and then click the filter you need.

This tool can filter seeds from (in theory, its been a while)

- 5GenSearch tool
- Pokefinder
- SSS4

  Though changing between them requires some knowledge of python to swap out which file is used (I haven't gotten around to finding a good way to do this yet).
